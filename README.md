# BioMothical Mod (Minecraft 1.5.2, Forge)  

This repository contains the **BioMothical Mod**, a Minecraft mod I created in 2013 when I was 13 years old and just beginning to learn programming. The mod was developed for the now-outdated Minecraft version 1.5.2 using **Minecraft Forge** and **Eclipse IDE**.

- **One custom mob** with unique behaviors.  
- **A custom biome** for exploration.  
- **Custom items and blocks** to enrich gameplay.  

## My Learning Journey  
This project marked my introduction to programming and game development. I learned Java, experimented with debugging, and explored creative problem-solving. The BioMothical Mod was a fun way to combine my love for Minecraft with my curiosity about technology, sparking my passion for software development.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Minecraft Forge (1.5.2)**
